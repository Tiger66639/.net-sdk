Although the underlying HTTP layer can be substituted (see further), it's recommended to use the default implementation.\r\n\r\nunirest-net, in turn, has the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n- `Microsoft.Bcl (≥ 1.1.10)`\r\n- `Microsoft.Bcl.Build (≥ 1.0.21)`\r\n- `Microsoft.Bcl.Async (≥ 1.0.168)`\r\n- `Newtonsoft.Json (≥ 7.0.1)`\r\n- `Microsoft.Net.Http (≥ 2.2.29)`\r\n\r\n### Supported platforms\r\n\r\n* ASP.NET 4.5, 4,6\r\n* ASP.NET 5\r\n* Android (Xamarin)\r\n* iOS (Xamarin)\r\n* WinRT and WinRT Phone (Windows 8 and Phone 8.1)\r\n* Windows Phone Silverlight 8\r\n\r\nAt this moment UAP10.0 (Universal App Platform) is not supported because of the dependancy on unirest-net that doesn't support that target.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nTo run the demos, you need to install [DreamFactory stack](https://bitnami.com/stack/dreamfactory) version 2.0+ on your machine.\r\n\r\n### Running the Address Book Demo\r\n\r\nConfigure the DreamFactory instance to run the app:\r\n\r\n- Enable [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) for development purposes.\r\n\t- In the admin console, navigate to the Config tab and click on CORS in the left sidebar.\r\n\t- Click Add.\r\n\t- Set Origin, Paths, and Headers to *.\r\n\t- Set Max Age to 0.\r\n\t- Allow all HTTP verbs and check the Enabled box.\r\n\t- Click update when you are done.\r\n\t- More info on setting up CORS is available [here](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/wiki/CORs-Configuration).\r\n\r\n- Create a default role for new users and enable open registration\r\n\t- In the admin console, click the Roles tab then click Create in the left sidebar.\r\n\t- Enter a name for the role and check the Active box.\r\n\t- Go to the Access tab.\r\n\t- Add a new entry under Service Access (you can make it more restrictive later).\r\n\t\t- set Service = All\r\n\t\t- set Component = *\r\n\t\t- check all HTTP verbs under Access\r\n\t\t- set Requester = API\r\n\t- Click Create Role.\r\n\t- Click the Services tab, then edit the user service. Go to Config and enable Allow Open Registration.\r\n\t- Set the Open Reg Role Id to the name of the role you just created.\r\n\t- Make sure Open Reg Email Service Id is blank, so that new users can register without email confirmation.\r\n\t- Save changes.\r\n\r\n- Import the package file for the app.\r\n\t- From the Apps tab in the admin console, click Import and locate add_dotnet.dfpkg file in DreamFactory.AddressBook/App_Package folder. The Address Book package contains the application description, schemas, and sample data.\r\n\t- Leave storage service and folder blank because this app will be running locally.\r\n\t- Click the Import button. If successful, your app will appear on the Apps tab. You may have to refresh the page to see your new app in the list.\r\n\t\r\n- Make sure you have a SQL database service named 'db'. Depending on how you installed DreamFactory you may or may not have a 'db' service already available on your instance. You can add one by going to the Services tab in the admin console and creating a new SQL service. Make sure you set the name to 'db'.\r\n\r\n- The demo also requires a couple of constants to be specified in DreamFactoryContext.cs file located in the DreamFactory.AddressBook project. Open the file and modify the settings to match your setup.\r\n```csharp\r\n\tpublic const string BaseAddress = \"http://localhost:8080\";\r\n\tpublic const string AppName = \"<app_name>\";\r\n\tpublic const string AppApiKey= \"<app_api_key>\";\r\n\tpublic const RestApiVersion Version = RestApiVersion.V2;\r\n\tpublic const string DbServiceName = \"db\";\r\n\tpublic const string FileServiceName = \"files\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now run the app by starting the DreamFactory.AddressBook project in your browser. When the app starts up you can register a new user, or log in as an existing user (ex. admin you've set up first time you opened DreamFactory admin app).\r\n\r\n### Running the Console Demo\r\n\r\nConsole demo requires a test user to be specified in Program.cs file. Open the file and modify the settings to match your setup.\r\n```csharp\r\n\tinternal const string BaseAddress = \"http://localhost:8080\";\r\n\tinternal const string AppName = \"<app_name>\";\r\n\tinternal const string AppApiKey = \"<app_api_key>\";\r\n\tinternal const string Email = \"<user_email>\";\r\n\tinternal const string Password = \"<user_password>\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n > Note that the test user must have a role which allows any HTTP verbs on any services/resources.\r\n\r\n* Open DreamFactoryNet solution in Visual Studio 2012 or newer;\r\n* Open Program.cs and modify the settings;\r\n* In *Solution Explorer* window find *DreamFactory.Demo* project, right-click on it and select *Set as StartUp project*;\r\n* In Visual Studio main menu, select *DEBUG -> Run without debugging*;\r\n* A console window will appear with demo output;\r\n* If the demo has been completed successfully, you will see the total number of tests executed. \r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\nThe API provides the following functions:\r\n\r\n1. Simple HTTP API, for making arbitrary HTTP requests;\r\n2. DreamFactory API (closely matching the Swagger definition),\r\n3. Various extensions and builders to simplify managing DreamFactory models.\r\n\r\nAll network-related API calls are asynchronous, they all have `Async` suffix.\r\nThe IO-bound calls (HTTP request and stream IO) have `ConfigureAwait(false)`.\r\n\r\n### Errors handling\r\n\r\n- On wrong arguments (preconditions), expect `ArgumentException` to be thrown.\r\n- On Bad HTTP status codes, expect `DreamFactoryException` to be thrown.\r\n> `DreamFactoryException` is normally supplied with a reasonable message provided by DreamFactory server, unless it fails with an HTML page returned with the response.\r\n\r\n- On content serialization errors (JSON by default), expect Json.NET exceptions to be thrown.\r\n> Serialization may fail if returned objects do not match the strongly-typed entities defined with the API.\r\n> This may happen in particular when DreamFactory services change their contract in a breaking way.   \r\n\r\n### HTTP API overview\r\n\r\nRegular users would not deal with this API subset unless they have outstanding needs to perform advanced queries.\r\nHowever, it is very likely that these users will step down this API while debugging, therefore it is recommended to know the basics.\r\n\r\nHTTP layer is defined with the following interfaces:\r\n\r\n- `IHttpFacade` with the single method `SendAsync()`,\r\n- `IHttpRequest` representing an HTTP request,\r\n- `IHttpResponse` representing an HTTP response,\r\n\r\nThe SDK comes with unirest-net implementation of `IHttpFacade` - the `UnirestHttpFacade` class. A user can define its own implementation to use it with DreamFactory API. Providing a custom `IHttpFacade` instance could be useful for mocking purposes and IoC. \r\n\r\n`IHttpRequest` supports HTTP tunneling, by providing `SetTunneling(HttpMethod)` function. This function modifies the request instance in according with the tunneling feature supported by DreamFactory.\r\n\r\nHere is an [example](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/HttpDemo.cs):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\tstring url = \"https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=16&format=h\";\r\n\tIHttpRequest request = new HttpRequest(HttpMethod.Get, url);\r\n\tIHttpFacade httpFacade = new UnirestHttpFacade();\r\n\tIHttpResponse response = await httpFacade.SendAsync(request);\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Response CODE = {0}, BODY = {1}\", response.Code, response.Body);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### DreamFactory API overview\r\n\r\nEach DreamFactory's service has a corresponding interface that exposes all functions you could find in Swagger definition. Some functions, however, were split and some were reduced to remain reasonable and consistent to .NET users.\r\n\r\nThe service instances are created with `IRestContext.Factory` methods:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\tIRestContext context = new RestContext(BaseAddress);\r\n\tIUserApi userApi = context.Factory.CreateUserApi();\r\n\tSession session = await userApi.LoginAsync(\"demo\", \"api_key\", \"user@mail.com\", \"qwerty\");\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Logged in as {0}\", session.display_name);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecify service name for creating an interface to a named service:\r\n```csharp\r\n\tIRestContext context = new RestContext(BaseAddress);\r\n\tIFilesApi filesApi = context.Factory.CreateFilesApi(\"files\");\r\n\tawait filesApi.CreateFileAsync(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Serialization\r\n\r\nThe API supports pluggable serialization. This SDK comes with the default `JsonContentSerializer` which is using [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).\r\nTo use your custom serializer, consider using the other `RestContext` constructor accepting a user-defined `IContentSerializer` instance.\r\n\r\nBy default Json.NET resolves property names as they are defined in the class unless specified otherwise with JsonPropertyAttribute. \r\n\r\n#### SQL query parameters\r\n\r\nMost DreamFactory resources persist in the system database, e.g. Users, Apps, Services. When calling CRUD API methods accessing these resources be prepared to deal with related SQL query parameters. All such APIs accept a `SqlQuery` class instance. You can populate any fields of this class, but do check swagger contract for the service you about to use. The API implementation will set any non-null fields as query parameters.\r\n\r\nDefault `SqlQuery` constructor populates the single property: *fields=**. This results in all fields to be read.\r\n\r\n#### REST API versioning\r\n\r\nSupported API versions defined by `RestApiVersion` enumeration. `V2` is used by default.\r\nThe SDK uses version for building the complete URL, e.g. /rest for V1 and /api/v2 for V2.\r\nNote that building the URL is done transparently to the users.\r\n\r\n#### IRestContext interface\r\n\r\nBesides the `IRestContext.Factory` object which is designed to construct service instances, the interface offers few discovery functions:\r\n\r\n- `GetServicesAsync()`\r\n- `GetResourcesAsync()`\r\n\r\nSee the [demo program](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/DiscoveryDemo.cs) for usage details.\r\n\r\n#### User API\r\n\r\n> See [IUserApi](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Api/IUserApi.cs) and [DEMO](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/UserDemo.cs)\r\n\r\nAll API calls require Application-Name header as well as Application-Api-Key to be set and many others require Session-ID header. Here is how these headers are managed by SDK:\r\n\r\n* Both Application-Name and Application-Api-Key are being set when initializng `RestContaxt`.\r\n* Session-ID header is set upon `IUserApi.LoginAsync()` or `ISystemApi.LoginAdminAsync()` completion,\r\n* Session-ID header gets removed upon `IUserApi.LogoutAsync()` or `ISystemApi.LogoutAdminAsync()` completion,\r\n* Session-ID header gets updated if another login is made during `ChangePasswordAsync()` or `ChangeAdminPasswordAsync()` call.\r\n\r\nTo use/set another Application-Name and Application-Api-Key you have to instantiate new `RestContaxt`.\r\n\r\n#### CustomSettings API\r\n\r\n> See [ICustomSettingsApi](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Api/ICustomSettingsApi.cs) and [DEMO](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/CustomSettingsDemo.cs)\r\n\r\nThe API can be created for user and system namespace.\r\nPlease refer to the demo for sample API usage.\r\n\r\n#### Files API\r\n\r\n> See [IFilesApi](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Api/IFilesApi.cs) and [DEMO](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/FilesDemo.cs)\r\n\r\nSummary on supported features:\r\n\r\n* CRUD operations on folders and files,\r\n* Bulk files upload/download in ZIP format,\r\n* Text and binary files read/write.\r\n\r\nReading/Writing of metadata associated with file entities (folder, file) are not supported.\r\n\r\n#### Database API\r\n\r\n> See [IDatabaseApi](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Api/IDatabaseApi.cs) and [DEMO](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/DatabaseDemo.cs)\r\n\r\n##### Notes on schema management\r\n\r\nTo simplify `TableSchema` construction, SDK offers `TableSchemaBuilder` class that implement Code First approach:\r\n```csharp\r\n\t// Your custom POCO\r\n\tclass StaffRecord\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic int Uid { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string FirstName { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic string LastName { get; set; }\r\n\t\tpublic int Age { get; set; }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Create tabe schema from StaffRecord type\r\n\tITableSchemaBuilder builder = new TableSchemaBuilder();\r\n\tbuilder.WithName(TableName).WithFieldsFrom<StaffRecord>().WithKeyField(\"uid\").Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more advanced scenarios and relationship building you should build up your own TableSchema object:\r\n```csharp\r\n\tTableSchema schema = new TableSchema();\r\n    schema.Name = \"<table_name>\";\r\n    schema.Field = new List<FieldSchema>\r\n    {\r\n        // fields...\r\n        new FieldSchema\r\n        {\r\n            Name = \"<foreign_key_column_name>\",\r\n            Type = \"reference\",\r\n            AllowNull = false,\r\n            RefTable = \"<related_table_name>\",\r\n            RefFields = \"<related_table_column_name>\"\r\n        },\r\n        // more fields...\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    await databaseApi.CreateTableAsync(staffSchema);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAPI does not offer schema operations on dedicated fields. Use `UpdateTableAsync` method to update any table's schema.\r\n\r\n##### Notes on table records operations\r\n\r\n* Input are user-defined POCO classes that must match the corresponding table's schema;\r\n* Output is instance of [DatabaseResourceWrapper](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Model/Database/DatabaseResourceWrapper.cs) containing records and metadata if it was requested.\r\n\r\n##### Notes on stored procedures/functions\r\n\r\nWhen calling a stored procedure or function, some overloads use a collection of `StoreProcParams` instances. To simplify creating such a collection, consider using `StoreProcParamsBuilder` class.\r\nWhen response (or return values) is expected, a user must define `TStoredProcResponse` POCO that shall have fields for OUT-parameters and for wrapper.\r\nIt's recommended to read the technical notes on stored procedures: https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core/wiki/SQL-Stored-Procedures\r\n\r\n#### Email API\r\n\r\n> See [IEmailApi](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Api/IEmailApi.cs) and [DEMO](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/EmailDemo.cs)\r\n\r\nSending an email will require `EmailRequest` object to be built.\r\nFor an advanced use, construct this object manually by providing all essential information.\r\nFor a simple use, consider using `EmailRequestBuilder` class that lets you building a request in few simple steps:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nEmailRequest request = new EmailRequestBuilder()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.AddTo(\"inbox@mail.com\")\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.WithSubject(\"Hello\")\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.WithBody(\"Hello, world!\")\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.Build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### System API\r\n\r\n> See [ISystemApi](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory/Api/ISystemApi.cs) and [DEMO](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/.net-sdk/blob/master/DreamFactory.Demo/Demo/SystemDemo.cs)\r\n\r\n##### Current limitations\r\n\r\n* Reading/writing of metadata related to system records are not supported.\r\n* Some related entities are not retrieved (see related query parameter).\r\n* Some related entities are retrieved as objects and are not strongly typed.\r\n* Some related entities that are strongly typed do not have any properties.\r\n",
